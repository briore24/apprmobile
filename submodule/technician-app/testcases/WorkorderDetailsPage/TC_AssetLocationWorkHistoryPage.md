# View the "Asset and location history" from work order details page

These test cases will verify the historical data of work orders performed for the asset/location added to the work order. Hence 'Asset and location history' page will show asset/location sections with "Asset/Location" number and description having the latest three status updated work orders performed for the asset/location by default on "Technician" web app, online and offline mode on mobile containers. These test cases will cover the functionalities of following stories:

- Graphite-31372: Eli can see his location work history
- GRAPHITE-10825: Eli can access his work history of an asset
- GRAPHITE-31535: Review Asset / Location history content
- GRAPHITE-56901: Eli wants to see details of Historical WO records

**Note:**

- In case of web app, all transactions are saved in database and refreshed on the UI in real time.
- In case of online mode on mobile containers, transactions are sent to the database for saving instantly but UI is not refreshed from database until 'Check Updates' button is clicked.
- In case of offline mode on mobile containers, transactions are queued for syncing to the database and synced to database once device is online. UI is not refreshed from database until 'Check Updates' button is clicked.
- All server side error messages will be displayed in error page on devices post syncing with server and tapping on 'Check Updates' button in both online and offline modes.
