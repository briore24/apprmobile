# Flow Control - Work order and corresponding tasks status change functionality

These test cases will verify work order and corresponding tasks flow control functionality on Technician web app, online and offline mode on mobile containers.

These test cases will cover functionality of following user stories:

- GRAPHITE-45237: Flow Control - Inherit status changes from the work order to the tasks
- GRAPHITE-45346: Flow Control - When completing the last task, WO should also be changed to COMP
- GRAPHITE-45259: Flow Control - when completing a task, others that have it as predecessor should be started
- GRAPHITE-45281: Flow Control - The work order cannot be completed until all tasks are completed
- GRAPHITE-75990:Add sigoption to make FSM flow optional

**Note:**

- In case of web app, all transactions are saved in database and refreshed on the UI in real time.
- In case of online mode on mobile containers, transactions are sent to the database for saving instantly but UI is not refreshed from database until 'Check Updates' button is clicked.
- In case of offline mode on mobile containers, transactions are queued for syncing to the database and synced to database once device is online. UI is not refreshed from database until 'Check Updates' button is clicked.
- All server side error messages will be displayed in error page on devices post syncing with server and tapping on 'Check Updates' button in both online and offline modes.
