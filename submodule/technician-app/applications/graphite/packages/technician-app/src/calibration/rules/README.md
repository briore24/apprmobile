# Technician App: Calibration business rules

## Handlers

Layer that communicates the view with the business rules.

## Helpers

A Helper can be a utility class or it can be stateful or require an instance be created.
It is more of a place where you store code architectural snippets in my view. Things essential for bootstrapping components and developer ergonomics.

## Models

Data models are visual representations of the enterprise's data elements and the connections between them.

## Utils

A Utility class is understood to only have static methods and be stateless. You would not create an instance of such a class.
A place where you can place small snippets you can use throughout the application. Small functions to build bigger things with.
